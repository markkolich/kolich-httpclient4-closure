# kolich-http-client

This project provides a convenient Java based wrapper around the Apache Commons HttpClient 4.x library.

As is, using the HttpClient 4 library is often cumbersome and bulky for your typical everyday `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` operations.  For example, it often takes multiple lines of boiler plate Java to send a simple `GET` request, check the resulting status code, read a response (if any) and close/free the connection back into the connection pool.  In *most* cases, you want to avoid the boiler plate overhead and just freakin' send HTTP requests without worrying about the internal musings of HttpClient.  This library lets you do that, fairly well.

## Latest Version

The latest stable version of this library is <a href="http://markkolich.github.com/repo/com/kolich/kolich-http-client/0.0.1">0.0.1</a>.

## Usage

TODO

## Building

This Java library and its dependencies are built and managed using <a href="https://github.com/harrah/xsbt">SBT 0.12.1</a>.

To clone and build kolich-http-client, you must have <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup">SBT 0.12.1 installed and configured on your computer</a>.

The kolich-http-client SBT <a href="https://github.com/markkolich/kolich-http-client/blob/master/project/Build.scala">Build.scala</a> file is highly customized to build and package this Java artifact.  It's written to manage all dependencies and versioning.

To build, clone the repository.

    #~> git clone git://github.com/markkolich/kolich-http-client.git

Run SBT from within kolich-http-client.

    #~> cd kolich-http-client
    #~/kolich-http-client> sbt
    ...
    kolich-http-client:0.0.1>

You will see a `kolich-http-client` SBT prompt once all dependencies are resolved and the project is loaded.

In SBT, run `package` to compile and package the JAR.

    kolich-http-client:0.0.1> package
    [info] Compiling 17 Java sources to ~/kolich-http-client/target/classes...
    [info] Packaging ~/kolich-http-client/dist/kolich-http-client-0.0.1.jar ...
    [info] Done packaging.
    [success] Total time: 4 s, completed

Note the resulting JAR is placed into the **kolich-http-client/dist** directory.

To create an Eclipse Java project for kolich-http-client, run `eclipse` in SBT.

    kolich-http-client:0.0.1> eclipse
    ...
    [info] Successfully created Eclipse project files for project(s):
    [info] kolich-http-client

You'll now have a real Eclipse **.project** file worthy of an Eclipse import.

Note your new **.classpath** file as well -- all source JAR's are fetched and injected into the Eclipse project automatically.

## Dependencies

Currently, this artifact depends on the <a href="http://hc.apache.org/">Apache Commons HttpClient</a> version **4.2.2**.

This library does **not** work with HttpClient 3.x.  If you are *still* using HttpClient 3.x you should really consider upgrading given that 3.x is past end-of-life and no longer supported. 

It also firmly depends on my common package of utility classes, <a href="https://github.com/markkolich/kolich-common">kolich-common</a>.
