# kolich-httpclient4-closure

A convenient Java wrapper around the Apache Commons HttpClient 4.x library.

As is, using HttpClient is often cumbersome and bulky for typical `HEAD`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` operations.  For example, it often takes multiple lines of boiler plate Java to send a simple `GET` request, check the resulting status code, read a response (if any) and close/free the connection back into the connection pool.

In *most* implementations, the typical HttpClient usage pattern almost always involves:

1. Creating a new `HttpHead`, `HttpGet`, `HttpPost`, `HttpPut`, or `HttpDelete` instance specific to the operation.
2. Setting an request body ("entity") to be sent with the request, if any.
3. Actually sending the request.
4. Checking the HTTP response status code.  If successful, do something.  If not successful, do something else.
5. Reading a response entity, if any.  If one exists, convert it to a `String` so you can do something with it.
6. Freeing the response and releasing the connection back into the underlying thread-safe connection pool.

The intent of this library is to let you do all of this in a cleaner, repeatable and understandable way.

Many would argue that this library simply trades one set of "boiler plate" for another.  True.  However, the patterns used here are much easier to grasp and they help you prevent obvious mistakes &mdash; like forgetting to close an `InputStream` when you're done with a response, which almost always manifests itself as a nasty leak under a heavy load.

```

## Usage

Technically speaking, this library does not use "closures" (Lambda expressions) but rather a well defined pattern with **anonymous classes**.

### Functional Concepts

Some concepts in this library, like the `HttpResponseEither<F,S>`, were borrowed directly from the Functional Programming world, namely Scala.  In this case, `HttpResponseEither<F,S>` uses Java generics so that this library can return *either* a left type `F` indicating failure, or a right type `S` indicating success.  It's up to you, the developer, to define what these types are &mdash; the definition of a "successful" return type varies from application to application, and developer to developer.

When you "get back" an `HttpResponseEither<F,S>` you can check for success by calling the `success` method on the result.

```java
final HttpResponseEither<Exception,String> result =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Exception,String>(client) {
    // ...
  }.get("http://example.com");

if(result.success()) {
  // It worked!
}
```

To extract the return value of type `S` on success, call `right` on the result.

```java
final String s = result.right();
```

To extract the return value of type `F` on failure, call `left` on the result.

```java
final Exception cause = result.left();
```

Note that if you call `right` on a request that failed, expect a `null` return value.  Similarly, if you call `left` on a request that succeeded, also expect a `null` return value.

A few other things to keep in mind:

* This library automatically releases/frees all connection resources when a request has finished, either successfully or unsuccessfully.  You don't have to worry about closing any internal entity streams, that's done for you.
* All return types are developer-defined based on how you parameterize your `HttpResponseEither<F,S>`.  It's up to you to write a `success` method which converts an `HttpSuccess` object to your desired success type `S`.
* The default definition of "success" is any request that 1) completes without `Exception` and 2) receives an HTTP status code that is less than (`<`) 400 Bad Request.  You can easily override this default behavior by implementing a custom `check` method as needed.
* If you need to manipulate the request immediately before execution, you should override the `before` method.  This lets you do things like sign the request, or add the right authentication headers before the request is sent.

### Get an HttpClient

Before you can make HTTP requests, you need an `HttpClient` instance.  You can use your own `HttpClient` (as instantiated elsewhere by another method), or you can use my `KolichDefaultHttpClient` factory class packaged with this library to snag a pre-configured `HttpClient`.

```java
import com.kolich.http.KolichDefaultHttpClient.KolichHttpClientFactory;

final HttpClient client = KolichHttpClientFactory.getNewInstanceWithProxySelector();
```

Or, pass a `String` to the factory method to set the HTTP `User-Agent` on your new `HttpClient` instance.

```java
final HttpClient client = KolichHttpClientFactory.getNewInstanceWithProxySelector("IE6, whoa");
```

By default, the `KolichHttpClientFactory` always returns an `HttpClient` instance backed by a **thread-safe** `PoolingClientConnectionManager`.  There's currently no support for passing your own connection manager to my `KolichHttpClientFactory` &mdash; if you need to use your own connection manager, it's safest to just build your own `HttpClient` instance elsewhere. 

### HttpClient Factory for Beans

You can use the `KolichHttpClientFactory` to also instantiate an `HttpClient` for your beans:

```xml
<bean id="YourHttpClient"
  class="com.kolich.http.KolichDefaultHttpClient.KolichHttpClientFactory"
  factory-method="getNewInstanceWithProxySelector">
  <!-- Set a custom User-Agent string too, if you want. -->
  <constructor-arg><value>IE6, seriously?</value></constructor-arg>
</bean>

<bean id="SomeFooBarBean" class="com.foo.bar.SomeBean">
  <property name="httpClient" ref="YourHttpClient" />			    	
</bean>
```

### Full Web-Proxy Support

Some environments require outgoing HTTP/HTTPS connections to use a web-proxy.

Fortunately, `HttpClient` integrates nicely with `java.net.ProxySelector` which makes it possible to automatically detect proxy settings across platforms.

That said, you can easily create a proxy-aware `HttpClient` instance using the right factory method from `KolichHttpClientFactory`.

```java
import com.kolich.http.KolichDefaultHttpClient.KolichHttpClientFactory;

final HttpClient lovesProxies = KolichHttpClientFactory.getNewInstanceWithProxySelector();

final HttpClient hatesProxies = KolichHttpClientFactory.getNewInstanceNoProxySelector();
```

When using the `getNewInstanceWithProxySelector()` factory method, the underlying `HttpClient` will automatically use the JVM's `java.net.ProxySelector` to discover what web-proxy to use when establishing outgoing HTTP connections.  On all platforms, you can manually tell the JVM default `java.net.ProxySelector` what web-proxy to use by setting the `http.proxyHost` and `http.proxyPort` VM arguments for vanilla HTTP connections.  For outgoing HTTPS connections, use `https.proxyHost` and `https.proxyPort`.

```bash
java -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.example.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=3128
```

### Examples

#### HEAD

Send a `HEAD` request and expect back an array of HTTP response headers on success.  Drop any failures on the floor &mdash; expect a `null` return value in place of success type `S` if anything went wrong.

```java
final HttpResponseEither<Void,Header[]> result =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Void,Header[]>(client) {
  @Override
  public Header[] success(final HttpSuccess success) {
    return success.getResponse().getAllHeaders();
  }
}.head("http://example.com");

final Header[] headers = result.right();
```

#### GET

Send a `GET` request expecting either a `String` back on success, or an `Exception` on failure &mdash; this is represented by the `HttpResponseEither<Exception,String>` return type.

```java
final HttpResponseEither<Exception,String> result =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Exception,String>(client) {
  @Override
  public String success(final HttpSuccess success) throws Exception {
    return EntityUtils.toString(success.getResponse().getEntity(), "UTF-8");
  }
  @Override
  public Exception failure(final HttpFailure failure) {
    return failure.getCause();
  }
}.get("http://example.com");
```

Or, send a `GET` request still expecting a `String` on success, but drop any failures on the floor &mdash; expect a `null` return value in place of success type `S` if anything went wrong.

```java
final HttpResponseEither<Void,String> result =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Void,String>(client) {
  @Override
  public String success(final HttpSuccess success) throws Exception {
    return EntityUtils.toString(success.getResponse().getEntity(), "UTF-8");
  }
}.get(new HttpGet("http://example.com/sdljflk8831sdflk")); // Obvious 404

System.out.println(result.right()); // Prints "null"
```

Send a `GET` request and stream the result on success to an existing and open `OutputStream`.

```java
import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils;

final OutputStream os = ...; // Existing and open output stream

final HttpResponseEither<Void,Long> result =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Void,Long>(client) {
  @Override
  public Long success(final HttpSuccess success) throws Exception {
    return IOUtils.copyLarge(
      success.getResponse().getEntity().getContent(),
      os);
  }
}.get("http://api.example.com/path/to/big/resource");

// Success result is the number of bytes copied.
System.out.println("I copied " + result.right() + " total bytes.");
```

Send a `GET` request and extract a `List<Cookie>` (list of `Cookie`'s) from the response, using the default `HttpContext` and a per-request `BasicCookieStore`.

```java
import static org.apache.http.client.protocol.ClientContext.COOKIE_STORE;
import org.apache.http.client.CookieStore;
import org.apache.http.impl.client.BasicCookieStore;

final HttpResponseEither<Integer,List<Cookie>> mmmm =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Integer,List<Cookie>>(client) {
  @Override
  public void before(final HttpRequestBase request, final HttpContext context) {
    context.setAttribute(COOKIE_STORE, new BasicCookieStore());
  }
  @Override
  public List<Cookie> success(final HttpSuccess success) {
    // Extract a list of cookies from the request.
    // Might be empty.
    return ((CookieStore)success.getContext()
      .getAttribute(COOKIE_STORE)).getCookies();
  }
  @Override
  public Integer failure(final HttpFailure failure) {
    return failure.getStatusCode();
  }
}.get("http://example.com");

// Get the list of extracted cookies from the response
// and print them out.  Mmmm, cookies.
final List<Cookie> cookies;
if((cookies = mmmm.right()) != null) {
  for(final Cookie c : cookies) {
    System.out.println(c.getName() + " -> " + c.getValue());
  }
}
```

#### POST

Send a `POST` request but manipulate the `HttpBaseRequest` object before execution by overriding the `before` method.  Expect a `String` on success, and an `Integer` on failure.

```java
final HttpResponseEither<Integer,String> result =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Integer,String>(client) {
  @Override
  public void before(final HttpRequestBase request) {
    request.addHeader("Authorization", "super-secret-password!");
  }
  @Override
  public String success(final HttpSuccess success) throws Exception {
    return EntityUtils.toString(success.getResponse().getEntity(), "UTF-8");
  }
  @Override
  public Integer failure(final HttpFailure failure) {
    // Return the HTTP status code if anything went wrong.
    return failure.getStatusCode();
  }
}.post("http://api.example.com");
```

Or, send a `POST` with some form variables, ignoring failures, and convert a successful response to some custom entity using Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/">GSON</a> toolkit.

```java
import com.google.gson.GsonBuilder;

final HttpPost request = new HttpPost("http://api.example.com");
// Set a POST-body on the request.
final List<NameValuePair> params = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>();
params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("foo", "bar"));
params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("cat", "dog"));
request.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(params, "UTF-8"));

final HttpResponseEither<Void,MyClazz> result =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Void,MyClazz>(client) {
  @Override
  public MyClazz success(final HttpSuccess success) throws Exception {
    // Expects JSON from the server in response to the POST.
    return new GsonBuilder().create().fromJson(
      EntityUtils.toString(success.getResponse().getEntity(), "UTF-8"),
      MyClazz.class);
  }
}.post(request);

final MyClazz entity = result.right(); // Kewl
```

#### PUT

Send a `PUT` request with an existing and open `InputStream` from another source.  Expect an `Integer` back on success and nothing on failure.

```java
final InputStream is = ...; // Existing and open input stream

final HttpResponseEither<Void,Integer> result =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Void,Integer>(client) {
  @Override
  public void before(final HttpRequestBase request) {
    ((HttpPut)request).setEntity(new InputStreamEntity(is, contentLength));
  }
  @Override
  public Integer success(final HttpSuccess success) throws Exception {
    return success.getStatusCode();
  }
}.put("http://api.example.com/upload");

if(result.success()) {
  System.out.println("PUT resulted in a " + result.right() + " status.");
}
```

#### DELETE

Send a `DELETE` request with a custom `success` check &mdash; in this example, the server returns a `410 Gone` when the resource is deleted successfully but we don't want a 410 response to indicate failure. 

```java
final HttpResponseEither<Integer,Void> result =
  new HttpClient4Closure<Integer,Void>(client) {
  @Override
  public boolean check(final HttpResponse response, final HttpContext context) {
    // Success is 410, any other status code is failure.
    return (response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode() == 410);
  }
  @Override
  public Void success(final HttpSuccess success) throws Exception {
    return null; // Meh, for Void
  }
  @Override
  public Integer failure(final HttpFailure failure) {
    // Return the HTTP status code if anything went "wrong".
    return failure.getStatusCode();
  }
}.delete("http://api.example.com/go/away");

if(result.success()) {
  // Got 401 Gone response from server, resource is "history".
}
```
